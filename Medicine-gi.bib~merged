abstract = {Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in vitro at temperatures less than 37°C and produce organ damage through two main pathways: vascular sludging (hyperviscosity syndrome, mainly in type I cryoglobulinaemia) and immune-mediated mechanisms (principally vasculitis, in mixed cryoglobulinaemia). Cryoglobulinaemia is associated with many illnesses, which can be broadly grouped into infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies; the most common cause is infection with hepatitis C virus. Mixed cryoglobulinaemic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has typical organ involvement (mainly skin, kidney, or peripheral nerve) and circulating cryoglobulins. Cutaneous purpura is the most common manifestation of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. The most frequently affected internal organs are the peripheral nerves, kidneys, and joints. The course varies widely and prognosis is influenced by both cryoglobulinaemic damage to vital organs and by comorbidities associated with underlying diseases. More than 90 of cases of cryoglobulinaemia have a known underlying cause; therefore treatment is focused on the cause of the disorder rather than merely symptomatic relief. Studies suggest that both combined or sequential antiviral therapies and targeted biological treatments might be more effective than monotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related Mixed Cryoglobulinemia (MC) is a unique condition with complex pathogenesis that involves HCV antigen-driven B-lymphocyte clonal proliferation and mutagenesis. Clinical spectrum of MC ranges from asymptomatic state to clinically-apparent vasculitis involving multiple organs. In the era of Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapy, patients with HCV-related MC achieve high rates of viral clearance that is commonly accompanied by an improvement in clinical symptoms as well as immunological profiles. Rituximab, either alone or in combination with DAA, has also been shown to be effective. Nevertheless, there have been limited and somewhat conflicting data, particularly over the long-term, regarding the rate and degree of clinical response of MC following DAA therapy. It appears that we have come quite a long way in the last decade with this condition. As with non-MC related HCV, undoubtedly long term outcome data will be forthcoming over the next few years. As we move forward successful therapy of HCV is not likely to be a challenge in contrast to access to therapy.},

@article{Bernal2015,
abstract = {Summary Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40{\%} of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dieulafoy's lesion is a relatively rare, but potentially life-threatening, condition. It accounts for 1-2{\%} of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, but arguably is under-recognised rather than rare. Its serious nature makes it necessary to include it in the differential diagnosis of obscure GI bleeding. The aim of this study was to review the current trends in the diagnosis and management of Dieulafoy's lesion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Medline, a literature search was performed for articles published in English, using the search words 'Dieulafoy'(s)' and 'gastrointestinal bleeding'. All retrieved papers were analysed and the findings are summarised in this review.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There is no consensus on the treatment of Dieulafoy's lesions. Therapeutic endoscopy can control the bleeding in 90{\%} of patients while angiography is being accepted as a valuable alternative to endoscopy for inaccessible lesions. Currently, surgical intervention is kept for failure of therapeutic endoscopic or angiographic interventions and it should be guided by pre-operative localisation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Advances in endoscopy have increased the detection of Dieulafoy's lesions and decreased the mortality from 80{\%} to 8.6{\%}. There are recent encouraging reports on the successful use of laparoscopic surgery in managing symptomatic Dieulafoy's lesions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM Chronic HCV infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs). Data on the effect of sustained virological response (SVR) on the risk of EHMs are limited. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data of patients from the US Veterans Affairs HCV Clinical Case Registry who had a positive HCV RNA test (10/1999-08/2009). Patients receiving interferon-based antiviral therapy (AVT) were identified. SVR was defined as negative HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after end of AVT. Risks of eight incident EHMs were evaluated in Cox regression models. RESULTS Of the 160 875 HCV-infected veterans, 31 143 (19.4{\%}) received AVT, of whom 10 575 (33.9{\%}) experienced SVR. EHM risk was reduced in the SVR group compared with untreated patients for mixed cryoglobulinaemia (adjusted HR (aHR)=0.61; 95{\%} CI 0.39 to 0.94), glomerulonephritis (aHR=0.62; 95{\%} CI 0.48 to 0.79), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) (aHR=0.41; 95{\%} CI 0.20 to 0.83), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (aHR=0.64; 95{\%} CI 0.43 to 0.95), diabetes (aHR=0.82; 95{\%} CI 0.76 to 0.88) and stroke (aHR=0.84; 95{\%} CI 0.74 to 0.94), but not for lichen planus (aHR=1.11; 95{\%} CI 0.78 to 1.56) or coronary heart disease (aHR=1.12; 95{\%} CI 0.81 to 1.56). Risk reductions were also observed when patients with SVR were compared with treated patients without SVR for mixed cryoglobulinaemia, glomerulonephritis, PCT and diabetes. Significant reductions in the magnitude of aHRs towards the null with increasing time to initiation of AVT after HCV diagnosis were observed for glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke. CONCLUSIONS Risks of several EHMs of HCV infection are reduced after AVT with SVR. However, early initiation of AVT may be required to reduce the risk of glomerulonephritis, NHL and stroke.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Fibroscan (FS) is a reliable noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic liver disease. However, there is no clear consensus with respect to the best FS cut-off values for use in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The aims of this study were as follows: (a) to compare the performance of FS and different biochemical markers in ALD patients; (b) to assess the best FS cut-off values for the prediction of fibrosis stage in our ALD population; and (c) to assess the influence of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values on FS. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 135 consecutive and compensated ALD patients who underwent liver biopsy between November 2006 and March 2012 at Erasme Hospital. FS, Fibrotest, FIB-4, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and Forns' scores were tested in all patients. RESULTS The diagnostic accuracy of FS was 0.89 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.83-0.95) for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis and 0.93 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.90-0.97) for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. FS performed better than Fibrotest (0.81 and 0.88), APRI (0.65 and 0.75), Forns' (0.64 and 0.78), and FIB-4 (0.70 and 0.73). The optimal cut-off values of liver stiffness (LS) for predicting METAVIR fibrosis stage F≥3 and F4 disease were 10.3 and 18.0 kPa, respectively. AST showed a significant positive correlation with LS (r=0.24, P=0.001). However, exclusion of patients with AST more than 50 IU/l only lowered the LS cut-off for the diagnosis of F4 (14 vs. 18.0 kPa). CONCLUSION FS is currently the most reliable noninvasive method for the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in ALD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy. METHODS: We enrolled 921 patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and randomly assigned 461 of them to a restrictive strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell below 7 g per deciliter) and 460 to a liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell below 9 g per deciliter). Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51{\%}), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14{\%}), did not receive transfusions (P{\textless}0.001) [corrected].The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95{\%} vs. 91{\%}; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.92; P=0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10{\%} of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16{\%} of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40{\%} as compared with 48{\%} (P=0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95{\%} CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P=0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Clinical spectrum of MC ranges from asymptomatic state to clinically-apparent vasculitis involving multiple organs. In the era of Direct-Acting Antiviral (DAA) therapy, patients with HCV-related MC achieve high rates of viral clearance that is commonly accompanied by an improvement in clinical symptoms as well as immunological profiles. Rituximab, either alone or in combination with DAA, has also been shown to be effective. Nevertheless, there have been limited and somewhat conflicting data, particularly over the long-term, regarding the rate and degree of clinical response of MC following DAA therapy. It appears that we have come quite a long way in the last decade with this condition. As with non-MC related HCV, undoubtedly long term outcome data will be forthcoming over the next few years. As we move forward successful therapy of HCV is not likely to be a challenge in contrast to access to therapy.},

We aimed to assess the clinical and immune effects of direct-acting antiviral treatment. Methods We performed a prospective study of 64 patients with HCV infection with circulating cryoglobulins receiving direct-acting antiviral therapy at a single center in Barcelona, Spain, from January 2014 through April 2016. Patients were classified as having CV (n = 35) or asymptomatic circulating cryoglobulins (ACC, n = 29). Clinical response was considered complete if a patient's Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (version 3) was 0, or if all affected organs improved 12 weeks after the end of therapy. A complete immunologic response (CIR) was defined as no detection of circulating cryoglobulins and normalized levels of complement and/or rheumatoid factor. Results Clinical manifestations of CV included purpura (65{\%}), weakness (70{\%}), arthralgia (31{\%}), myalgia (20{\%}), peripheral neuropathy (50{\%}), and renal involvement (20{\%}). At baseline, patients with CV had significantly higher levels of rheumatoid factor and lower levels of C4 complement than patients with ACC, whereas cryocrits were similar between groups (3.2{\%} vs 2.6{\%}). Overall, 60 patients (94{\%}) had a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. Among patients with CV, the median Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (version 3) decreased from 9 (range, 2–31) to 3 (range, 0–12) (P {\textless} .001). Twenty-five patients with CV (71{\%}) achieved a complete clinical response. Immune-suppressive therapy was reduced for 4 of 13 patients and withdrawn for 6 of 13. Overall, 48{\%} of patients achieved a CIR. A low baseline cryocrit level ({\textless}2.7{\%}) was the only factor associated with CIR (odds ratio, 9.8; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.2–44; P = .03). Conclusions Viral eradication was associated with clinical improvement in most patients with CV. Markers of immune activation, including circulating cryoglobulins, persisted in 52{\%} of patients with CV or ACC, despite a sustained viral response 12 weeks after therapy. A longer follow-up period after viral eradication might be necessary to ensure a normal immune response.},

abstract = {Ever since its description approximately 100 years ago, the sphincter of Oddi has been surrounded by controversy. First, whether it indeed existed, second, whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the manometry, we have subdivided the dysfunction into two groups; a group characterised by a stenotic pattern - that is, raised sphincter basal pressure - and a second group having a dyskinetic pattern - that is, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin injection, rapid contraction frequency, high percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal pressure. It is apparent from the mamometry but also from the clinical data that the patients are a heterogeneous group and thus any therapy would need to be tailored for each patient and abnormality. The most recent therapeutic data suggest that patients with the stenotic pattern on manometry respond to division of the sphincter, however, those patients with the dyskinetic manometric pattern show no significant effect after sphincterotomy. Further prospective trials evaluating therapeutic options are under way and their results are eagerly awaited.},

abstract = {Cryoglobulins are cold-precipitable immunoglobulins associated with a number of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Their appearance along with rheumatoid factor (RF) can be considered a normal event in the clearance of immune complexes and rarely produces any symptoms. The association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) has been rendered evident since the recognition of serological markers of HCV infection. There is thus every reason to suppose that direct or indirect involvement of B cells on the part of the HCV results in their persistent stimulation, clonal expansion and release of molecules with RF activity. The formation of RF/IgG immune complexes is the key pathogenetic mechanism. The close correlation between HCV infection and MC also throws new light on the interpretation of autoimmune phenomena in the course of viral infection and on the close link between autoimmune diseases and lymphoproliferative disorders. The higher risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) displayed by HCV positive subjects, especially in the Mediterranean basin, suggests that the HCV's chronic lymphoproliferative drive may progress towards frank lymphoid neoplasia. The presence of MC does not represent an in situ or 'occult' NHL, because recent evidences indicate that none of the clones interpreted as predominant displays the molecular features of a true neoplastic process. The cryoglobulinemic syndrome is probably the consequence of pathogenic noxae that act upon the immune system of a host in which regulation of the peripheral T cell response appears to be in some way altered.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The hemoglobin threshold for transfusion of red cells in patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding is controversial. We compared the efficacy and safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy with those of a liberal transfusion strategy. METHODS: We enrolled 921 patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and randomly assigned 461 of them to a restrictive strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin level fell below 7 g per deciliter) and 460 to a liberal strategy (transfusion when the hemoglobin fell below 9 g per deciliter). Randomization was stratified according to the presence or absence of liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients assigned to the restrictive strategy (51{\%}), as compared with 61 assigned to the liberal strategy (14{\%}), did not receive transfusions (P{\textless}0.001) [corrected].The probability of survival at 6 weeks was higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group (95{\%} vs. 91{\%}; hazard ratio for death with restrictive strategy, 0.55; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.92; P=0.02). Further bleeding occurred in 10{\%} of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group as compared with 16{\%} of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.01), and adverse events occurred in 40{\%} as compared with 48{\%} (P=0.02). The probability of survival was slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95{\%} CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95{\%} CI, 0.11 to 0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child-Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P=0.03) but not in those assigned to the restrictive strategy. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

A comprehensive systematic review was performed to evaluate its presentation, diagnosis and treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: A systematic review was carried out of Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Cochrane databases for all articles published between 1998 and 2011. Only studies describing stercoral perforation were included.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Twenty-four relevant articles were found including 137 patients (median age = 62 years) with stercoral perforation, of whom 81{\%} had chronic constipation. Stercoral perforation was diagnosed by CT scan in 90{\%} of 31 patients, with the commonest findings being a combination of faecal impaction (84{\%}) and subphrenic (90{\%}) or extraluminal air (61{\%}). The commonest site of perforation was the sigmoid colon (50{\%}) followed by the rectosigmoid junction (24{\%}).

The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of these studies for the differential diagnosis of bone and liver diseases, particularly when elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels were not associated with abnormal results of other biochemical tests for liver function. Bone alkaline phosphatase was found to be more heat-labile than liver alkaline phosphatase and the two can be differentiated by pre-incubating the serum at 56" for IO min before enzyme assay. After heat treatment, serum alkaline phosphatase levels decreased to less than 12{\%} of the original activity in patients with bone diseases and to zo-400/o of the original activity in patients with liver diseases.},

abstract = {Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate in vitro at temperatures less than 37°C and produce organ damage through two main pathways: vascular sludging (hyperviscosity syndrome, mainly in type I cryoglobulinaemia) and immune-mediated mechanisms (principally vasculitis, in mixed cryoglobulinaemia). Cryoglobulinaemia is associated with many illnesses, which can be broadly grouped into infections, autoimmune disorders, and malignancies; the most common cause is infection with hepatitis C virus. Mixed cryoglobulinaemic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has typical organ involvement (mainly skin, kidney, or peripheral nerve) and circulating cryoglobulins. Cutaneous purpura is the most common manifestation of cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis. The most frequently affected internal organs are the peripheral nerves, kidneys, and joints. The course varies widely and prognosis is influenced by both cryoglobulinaemic damage to vital organs and by comorbidities associated with underlying diseases. More than 90 of cases of cryoglobulinaemia have a known underlying cause; therefore treatment is focused on the cause of the disorder rather than merely symptomatic relief. Studies suggest that both combined or sequential antiviral therapies and targeted biological treatments might be more effective than monotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary Acute-on-chronic liver failure combines an acute deterioration in liver function in an individual with pre-existing chronic liver disease and hepatic and extrahepatic organ failures, and is associated with substantial short-term mortality. Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40{\%} of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

abstract = {Ever since its description approximately 100 years ago, the sphincter of Oddi has been surrounded by controversy. First, whether it indeed existed, second, whether it had a significant physiological role in man and more recently whether abnormalities in its function give rise to a clinical syndrome. Data from animal and human studies, using sensitive techniques, have helped define the physiological role of the sphincter of Oddi, and more recent studies are determining the factors which control sphincter of Oddi function. These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems. The controversy of whether abnormalities in sphincter of Oddi motility result in clinical syndromes has not been totally resolved. Part of the difficulty has been inability to document normal and hence abnormal function of the sphincter. With the emergence of endoscopic biliary manometry as a sensitive and reproducible technique, however, the motility of the human sphincter of Oddi has come under closer scrutiny and allowed definition of possible disorders. We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin. Based on the manometry, we have subdivided the dysfunction into two groups; a group characterised by a stenotic pattern - that is, raised sphincter basal pressure - and a second group having a dyskinetic pattern - that is, paradoxical response to cholecystokinin injection, rapid contraction frequency, high percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal percentage of retrograde contractions, or short periods of raised basal pressure. It is apparent from the mamometry but also from the clinical data that the patients are a heterogeneous group and thus any therapy would need to be tailored for each patient and abnormality. The most recent therapeutic data suggest that patients with the stenotic pattern on manometry respond to division of the sphincter, however, those patients with the dyskinetic manometric pattern show no significant effect after sphincterotomy. Further prospective trials evaluating therapeutic options are under way and their results are eagerly awaited.},
