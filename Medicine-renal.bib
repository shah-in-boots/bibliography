Buenos Aires Argentina. alandini@agro.uba.ar RESUMEN El conocimiento del proceso de infiltraci{\'{o}}n del agua en el suelo es de importancia en el dise{\~{n}}o de sistemas de riego y en la predicci{\'{o}}n de la vulnerabilidad a la contaminaci{\'{o}}n del suelo y de las aguas subterr{\'{a}}neas. Por otra parte, es importante evaluar la eficiencia de los modelos hidrol{\'{o}}gicos que predicen el movimiento del agua en el suelo. El objetivo de este trabajo fue evaluar y comparar la bondad de ajuste de los modelos de infiltraci{\'{o}}n de Kostiakov-Lewis (K-L) y Philip (Ph) a los datos experimentales, obtenidos en tres suelos: dos en la Pcia. de Buenos Aires y uno en el predio experimental de la Facultad de Agronom{\'{i}}a de la Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Los modelos de K-L y Ph ajustaron con R 2 mayores a 0,6 de lo cual se concluye que son altamente eficientes para describir el com-portamiento de la infiltraci{\'{o}}n de agua en los suelos estudiados. La mayor tasa de infiltraci{\'{o}}n b{\'{a}}sica (fo) fue de 0,42 cm min -1 y correspondi{\'{o}} a un suelo arcillo-limoso con enmienda org{\'{a}}nica. Los otros dos suelos, franco-limoso y franco-arcilloso, exhibieron valores m{\'{a}}ximos de 0,03 y 0,07 cm min -1 respectivamente. El modelo de GA, a partir de las FPT, predijo los valores de infiltraci{\'{o}}n con coeficientes de eficiencia (CE) mayores a 0,8 para dos de los suelos estudiados, aunque se obtuvieron algunas discrepancias por debajo de los 20 cm de profundidad. Para el suelo franco limoso las FPT predijeron la curva caracter{\'{i}}stica de humedad con un CE cercano a 0,9. Se aconseja realizar un n{\'{u}}mero peque{\~{n}}o de ensayos preliminares en cualquier suelo bajo estudio, y analizar la bondad de predicci{\'{o}}n de estas funciones en esos sitios, des-cartando de este modo, situaciones que se apartan de las hip{\'{o}}tesis del modelo.

ABSTRACT The knowledge of the process of water infiltration in soil is important in the design of irrigation systems and in the prediction of the vulnerability to the contamination of soil and groundwater. Moreover, it is important to evaluate the efficiency of the hydrological models that predict the movement of water in soil. The objective of this study was to evaluate and to compare the goodness of fitting of Kostiakov-Lewis (K-L) and Philip (Ph) infiltration models to experimental data obtained from three soils: two of them at the Province of Buenos Aires, and the third one at the School of Agronomy's campus of the Buenos Aires University, (Argentina). Efficiency of Saxton and Rawls (SyR) pedotransfer functions (FPT) on the determination of the Green and Ampt (GA) model input hydraulic parameters and the prediction of the soil-moisture release curve were analyzed too. K-L and Ph models fitted data with R 2 coefficient greater than 0.6. Then it was concluded that these models accurately describe the infiltration process of the studied soils. The highest basic infiltration rate (fo) was 0.42 cm min -1 and corresponded to a silty clay soil with organic amendment, and for the other two soils (silt loam and clay loam) were 0.03 and 0.07 cm min},

abstract = {The difference in death rate among medical and surgical inpatients having alkalemia is incompletely defined. This prospective study was done to identify the incidence, mortality, and clinical factors that resulted in a poor outcome in both groups of patients. We screened a total of 10,811 consecutive arterial blood gas values; in 4,427 (40.9{\%}) the pH was greater than 7.44, and in 2,577 (23.8{\%}) the pH was greater than 7.48. The study group consisted of 409 patients (213 medical, 196 surgical) whose pH value was greater than 7.48; 253 of these patients (61.9{\%}) had pure respiratory alkalosis, 120 (29.3{\%}) had mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis, 27 (6.6{\%}) had a mixed acid base disorder, and nine (2.2{\%}) had pure metabolic alkalosis. Overall group mortality was 27.9{\%} and increased as pH values rose, reaching 48.5{\%} when the pH was greater than 7.60. The overall mortality among medical patients (36.6{\%}) exceeded that among the surgical patients (12.4{\%}) (P less than .05), an observation that applied over a wide range of pH values. Patients having mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis had a significantly poorer outcome (44.2{\%} mortality) than the alkalemic group as a whole (27.9{\%} mortality) (P less than .05). Alkalemia-associated illnesses are common in hospitalized patients and are associated with high mortality in both medical and surgical patients, though the death rate is higher among medical patients. Mixed respiratory and metabolic alkalosis appears to be associated with a particularly poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are among the most common electrolyte disorders. Since the plasma sodium level is determined by the ratio between the total quantity of effective solutes (primarily sodium and potassium salts) and the total body water, abnormalities in the plasma sodium level must be produced by a change in one or more of these parameters. In most patients, alterations in body water are of primary importance because the plasma sodium level is normally regulated by changing water intake and water excretion. Measurement of free water excretion has traditionally been calculated by using a formula that includes the urine osmolality. However, urea is a major urinary solute but does not contribute to regulation of the plasma sodium level, since it is an ineffective osmole. As a result, urinary solute excretion is best expressed as 2 × UNa+K. Making this important correction allows solute and water intake and excretion to be compared, thereby leading to a better understanding of both the development and correction of disturbances in the plasma sodium level. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {T his review describes a method of analyzing acid–base disorders that incorporates insights from the traditional, bicarbonate-centered model and the Stewart (or strong ion) model (Table 1). 1-6 Acid–base balance and electrolyte homeostasis are intricately connected at the cellular level and in clinical disorders. This article emphasizes the integration of the principles of mass balance and electroneutrality — which are prominently featured in the strong ion model (also known as the physicochemical model) — for interpretation of acid–base phenomena. Most acid–base abnormalities can be diagnosed and interpreted with the use of the traditional approach. Why, then, should the strong ion theory be in-corporated into teaching about acid–base balance? Although the Stewart model is not primarily a mathematical expression of a confirmed reality, it is relevant be-cause it is a powerful construct that can shed light on an important biologic system. Included in this article are several case vignettes that show the explanatory power of the strong ion approach in clinical practice. Some of these examples have been presented in a companion article on the physiological approach to acid–base balance by Berend et al. 7 Other cases that are interpreted with a strong ion ap-proach are included in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

Its major causes include trauma, ischemia, drugs, toxins, metabolic disorders, and infections. The pathophysiological hallmark of the syndrome is an increase in intracellular free ionized calcium due to either cellular energy depletion, or direct plasma membrane rupture. The increased intracellular calcium activates several proteases, intensifies skeletal muscle cell contractility, induces mitochondrial dysfunction, and increases the production of reactive oxygen species, ultimately resulting in skeletal muscle cell death. Clinically, the syndrome presents with severe muscular pain, weakness and myoglobinuria. Increased myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase as a consequence of muscular cell death are the major laboratory findings, which, in combination with the clinical presentation, lead the clinician to the final diagnosis of the syndrome. {\textcopyright} 2006 European Federation of Internal Medicine.},

The peak values occurred within 72 h of hospitalization. There was no significant difference among patients with (9,044 +/- 1,154 U/l) and without acute renal failure (ARF; 9,125 +/- 3,067 U/l). Similarly, marked elevation in both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed within 72 h after admission to the hospital. They were significantly higher in patients with ARF (ALT: 4,718 +/- 785 vs. 2,496 +/- 927 U/l, p less than 0.01; AST: 3,635 +/- 820 vs. 1,352 +/- 624 U/l, p less than 0.01). Hyperbilirubinemia was noted in 13 of 22 (60{\%}) patients with ARF and in 5 of the 12 (41{\%}) of those without ARF. Serum levels of bilirubin ranged from 2.6 to 14.3 mg/dl. Prothrombin time was prolonged in 4 of 12 (33{\%}) without ARF and in 14 of 22 (63{\%}) of patients with ARF. This abnormality lasted from 1 to 13 days. The magnitude and duration of hyperbilirubinemia and abnormal prothrombin time were similar in patients with and without ARF.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Although metabolic alkalosis is a common occurrence in intensive care units (ICUs), no study has evaluated its prevalence or outcomes in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients suffering from severe sepsis and septic shock admitted to the ICUs of Halmstad and Varberg County hospitals. From 910 patient records, 627 patients met the inclusion criteria. We investigated the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and mortality. Further, we studied the relationship between metabolic alkalosis and ICU length of stay (LOS). RESULTS Metabolic alkalosis was associated with decreased 30-day and 12-month mortalities. This effect was however lost when a multivariate analysis was conducted, correcting for age, gender, pH on admission, base excess (BE) on admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) and acute kidney injury (AKI). We then analyzed for any dose-response effect between the severity of metabolic alkalosis and mortality and found no relationship. Bivariate analysis showed that metabolic alkalosis had a significant effect on the length of ICU stay. When adjusting for age, sex, pH at admission, BE at admission, SAPS III and AKI in a multivariate analysis, metabolic alkalosis significantly contributed to prolonged ICU length of stay. In two separate sensitivity analyses pure metabolic alkalosis and late metabolic alkalosis (time of onset {\textgreater}48 hours) were the only significant predictor of increased ICU length of stay. CONCLUSION Metabolic alkalosis did not have any effect on 30-day and 12-month mortalities after adjusting for age, sex, SAPS III-score, pH and BE on admission and AKI in a multivariate analysis. The presence of metabolic alkalosis was independently associated with an increased ICU length of stay.},

abstract = {I nternal acid–base homeostasis is fundamental for maintaining life. Accurate and timely interpretation of an acid–base disorder can be lifesav-ing, but the establishment of a correct diagnosis may be challenging. 1 The three major methods of quantifying acid–base disorders are the physiological approach, the base-excess approach, and the physicochemical approach (also called the Stew-art method). 2 This article reviews a stepwise method for the physiological approach. The physiological approach uses the carbonic acid–bicarbonate buffer system. Based on the isohydric principle, this system characterizes acids as hydrogen-ion donors and bases as hydrogen-ion acceptors. The carbonic acid–bicarbonate sys-tem is important in maintaining homeostatic control. In the physiological ap-proach, a primary change in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco 2) causes a secondary " adaptive " response in the bicarbonate concentration and vice versa; further changes in carbon dioxide or bicarbonate reflect additional changes in acid–base status. The four recognized primary acid–base disorders comprise two metabolic disorders (acidosis and alkalosis) and two respiratory disorders (acidosis and alkalosis). The hydrogen-ion concentration is tightly regulated because changes in hydro-gen ions alter virtually all protein and membrane functions. 2-6 Since the concen-tration of hydrogen ions in plasma is normally very low (approximately 40 nmol per liter), the pH, which is the negative logarithm of the hydrogen-ion concentra-tion, is generally used in clinical medicine to indicate acid–base status. 3-5,7 The terms " acidemia " and " alkalemia " refer to states in which the blood pH is abnor-mally low (acidic) or abnormally high (alkaline). The process in which the hydro-gen-ion concentration is increased is called acidosis, and the process in which the hydrogen-ion concentration is decreased is called alkalosis. 3,4 The traditional de-termination of acid–base values is based on the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation (in which pK denotes the acid dissociation constant): pH = pK + log 10 (bicarbonate [HCO 3},
