abstract = {RATIONALE: Inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound (US) has been studied as a surrogate marker for right-sided filling pressures of the heart. The increased availability of bedside ultrasound has led to the use of this tool in the assessment of the fluid status of hypotensive patients. Dynamic changes in the IVC diameter can guide fluid resuscitation in a small subset of patients. We aimed to study whether resident physicians at different levels of training were able to identify patients in whom an IVC US would gauge intravascular fluid status appropriately. METHODS: We created a voluntary and anonymous questionnaire describing five distinct clinical vignettes and asked participants to identify whether they believed ultrasonography of the inferior vena cava would aid in determining the intravascular fluid status of the patient in question. Participants who chose IVC ultrasound as a modality to determine intravascular status were asked a follow-up question on whether IVC compressibility, distensibility, both, or neither should be assessed to make this determination. The survey included 35 internal medicine residents, 3 did not complete the survey. RESULTS: Residents at all levels of training favored using isolated IVC ultrasound to assess the intravascular fluid status of septic patients, irrespective of individual patient and scenario characteristics. 51% of participants favored IVC ultrasound in an inadequately resuscitated patient with septic shock. A majority endorsed the use of this tool, in patients that had already undergone adequate fluid resuscitation at 76.5%. 66% selected it in patients with underlying high right-sided pressures. 59.3% chose IVC US in mechanically ventilated patients with neuromuscular blockade and 37.5% without it. Of the participants that chose IVC ultrasound, no clear pattern emerged regarding which parameter they favored. Most residents chose collapsibility. In patients with ARDS who were mechanically ventilated, distensibility was more popular. 85% of residents surveyed felt that point of care ultrasonography should be incorporated into residency curriculum; the remainder were undecided. Results are summarized in Table1. CONCLUSIONS: Internal medicine resident physicians at all levels of training appear to be deficient in identifying the population of patients in whom IVC ultrasound can be appropriately used to assess fluid status. A majority of residents favored sub-optimal parameters when looking at the IVC indicating a knowledge gap. As portable ultrasonography becomes ubiquitous care must be taken, especially in unsupervised settings, to educate and train all operators before it is allowed to direct therapy in septic patients.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Central venous pressure (CVP) can be estimated by ultrasound of the inferior vena cava (IVC), but imaging the IVC is sometimes challenging. The femoral vein is easily imaged by ultrasound and might therefore provide an alternate target for estimating CVP. OBJECTIVES: To assess femoral vein diameter (FVD) measured by ultrasound imaging for estimating CVP. METHODS: We prospectively measured CVP and FVD in 97 patients. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the ability of FVD to predict specific CVP values: less than 10 mm Hg, less than 8 mm Hg (low CVP), and greater than 12 mm Hg (high CVP). Interobserver variability of FVD measurement was assessed in 20 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was moderate correlation between FVD and CVP (r = 0.66, P < 0.001). FVD less than or equal to 0.8 cm was the best predictor of CVP < 10 mm Hg, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.894 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.82 to 0.97. FVD less than or equal to 0.7 cm performed best for predicting low CVP (AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99) and FVD greater than or equal to 1.0 cm for high CVP (AUC = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89). However, FVD greater than or equal to 1.2 cm had the greatest specificity (94%) for high CVP. Interobserver variability in FVD measurements was 8.3 +/- 7.2%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study suggest that the accuracy of FVD measured by ultrasound imaging for estimating CVP is comparable to that which has been reported for ultrasound measurement of IVC diameter. FVD may provide an alternative approach when the IVC is difficult to image. Additional studies on other cohorts of patients are warranted to validate our proposed FVD cutoff values for predicting low and high CVP.},

abstract = {Background: Ultrasound measurement of dynamic changes in inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and collapsibility index (CI) are used to estimate the fluid responsiveness and intravascular volume status. We conducted an analysis to quantify the sonographic measurement of IVC diameter changes in adult patients at the preoperative and postoperative periods. Methods: Ultrasonography was performed on 72 patients scheduled for surgery with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to III. Quantitative assessments of the end-expiration (Dmin), end-inspiration (Dmax), and CI at preoperative and postoperative period were compared in a prospective, observational study. The patients received intravenous fluid according to standard protocol regimes peroperatively. Results: Ultrasonography of IVC measurement was unsuccessful in 12.5% of patients and 63 patients remained for analyses. The mean age was 43.29 ± 17.22 (range 18–86) years. The average diameter of the Dmin, Dmax, and dIVC preoperative and postoperative were 1.99 ± 0.31 vs. 2.05 ± 0.29 cm, 1.72 ± 0.33 vs. 1.74 ± 0.32 cm, 14.0 ± 9.60% vs. 15.14 ± 11.18%, respectively (p > 0.05). CI was positively associated preoperatively and postoperatively (regression coefficient = 0.438, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The diameter of the IVC did not change preoperatively and postoperatively in adult patients with standard fluid regimens. The parameters of the IVC diameter increased postoperatively according to the preoperative period.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Fluid responsiveness is the ability to increase the cardiac output in response to a fluid challenge. Only about 50% of patients receiving fluid resuscitation for acute circulatory failure increase their stroke volume, but the other 50% may worsen their outcome. Therefore, predicting fluid responsiveness is needed. In this purpose, in recent years, the assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) through ultrasound (US) has become very popular. The aim of our work was to systematically review all the previously published studies assessing the accuracy of the diameter of IVC or its respiratory variations measured through US in predicting fluid responsiveness. DATA SOURCES We searched in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science databases for all relevant articles from inception to September 2017. STUDY SELECTION Included articles specifically addressed the accuracy of IVC diameter or its respiratory variations assessed by US in predicting the fluid responsiveness in critically ill ventilated or not, adult or pediatric patients. DATA EXTRACTION We included 26 studies that investigated the role of the caval index (IVC collapsibility or distensibility) and 5 studies on IVC diameter. DATA SYNTHESIS We conducted a meta-analysis for caval index with 20 studies: The pooled area under the curve, logarithmic diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.83), 2.02 (95% CI: 1.29-2.89), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.80), and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85), respectively. CONCLUSION An extreme heterogeneity of included studies was highlighted. Ultrasound evaluation of the diameter of the IVC and its respiratory variations does not seem to be a reliable method to predict fluid responsiveness.},

@article{Finnerty2017,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION Intravascular volume status is an important clinical consideration in the management of the critically ill. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has gained popularity as a non-invasive means of intravascular volume assessment via examination of the inferior vena cava (IVC). However, there are limited data comparing different acquisition techniques for IVC measurement by POCUS. The goal of this evaluation was to determine the reliability of three IVC acquisition techniques for volume assessment: sub-xiphoid transabdominal long axis (LA), transabdominal short axis (SA), and right lateral transabdominal coronal long axis (CLA) (aka "rescue view"). METHODS Volunteers were evaluated by three experienced emergency physician sonographers (EP). Gray scale (B-mode) and motion-mode (M-mode) diameters were measured and IVC collapsibility index (IVCCI) calculated for three anatomic views (LA, SA, CLA). For each IVC measurement, we calculated descriptive statistics, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and two-way univariate analyses of variance. RESULTS EPs evaluated 39 volunteers, yielding 351 total US measurements. Measurements of the three views had similar means (LA 1.9 ± 0.4cm; SA 1.9 ± 0.4cm; CLA 2.0 ± 0.5cm). For B-Mode, LA had the highest ICC (0.86, 95% CI [0.76-0.92]) while CLA had the poorest ICC (0.74, 95% CI [0.56-0.85]). ICCs for all M-mode IVCCI were low. Significant interaction effects between anatomical view and EP were observed for B-mode and M-mode measurements. Post-hoc analyses revealed difficulty in consistent view acquisition between EPs. CONCLUSION Inter-rater reliability of the IVC by EPs was highest for B-mode LA and poorest for all M-Mode IVC collapsibility indices (IVCCI). These results suggest that B-mode LA holds the most promise to deliver reliable measures of IVC diameter. Future studies may focus on validation in a clinical setting as well as comparison to a reference standard.},

abstract = {Background Ultrasound measurement of the inferior vena cava diameter and its respiratory variability are amongst the predictors of fluid volume status. The primary purpose of the present study was to compare the consistency of inferior vena cava diameter measurements and the collapsibility index, obtained with convex and cardiac transducers. A secondary aim was to assess the agreement of the patient's allocation to one of the two groups: "fluid responder" or "fluid non-responder", based on inferior vena cava collapsibility index calculation made with two different probes. Methods 20 experienced clinicians blinded to the purpose of the study analysed forty anonymized digital clips of images obtained during ultrasound examination of 20 patients. For each patient, one digital loop was recorded with a cardiac and the second with a convex probe. The participants were asked to determine the maximal and minimal diameters of the inferior vena cava in all presented films. An independent researcher performed a comparative analysis of the measurements conducted with both probes by all participants. The calculation of the collapsibility index and allocation to "fluid responder" or "fluid non-responder" group was performed at this stage of the study. Results The comparison of measurements obtained with cardiac and convex probes showed no statistically significant differences in the measurements of the maximal and minimal dimensions and in the collapsibility index. We also noticed that the decision of allocation to the "fluid responder" or "non-responder" group was not probe-dependent. Conclusion Both transducers can be used interchangeably for the estimation of the studied dimensions.},
