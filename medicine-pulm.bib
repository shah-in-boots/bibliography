abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to analyze the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony during pressure support ventilation (PSV). Solving the model revealed several results. 1) Ratio of the flow at the end of patient neural inspiration to peak inspiratory flow (VTI/V(peak)) during PSV is determined by the ratio of time constant of the respiratory system (tau) to patient neural inspiratory time (TI) and the ratio of the set pressure support (Pps) level to maximal inspiratory muscle pressure (Pmus max). 2) VTI/V(peak) is affected more by tau/TI than by Pps/Pmus max. VTI/V(peak) increases in a sigmoidal relationship to tau/TI. An increase in Pps/Pmus max slightly shifts the VTI/V(peak)-tau/TI curve to the right, i.e., VTI/V(peak) becomes lower as Pps/Pmus max increases at the same tau/TI. 3) Under the selected adult respiratory mechanics, VTI/V(peak) ranges from 1 to 85{\%} and has an excellent linear correlation with tau/TI. 4) In mechanical ventilators, single fixed levels of the flow termination criterion will always have chances of both synchronized termination and asynchronized termination, depending on patient mechanics. An increase in tau/TI causes more delayed and less premature termination opportunities. An increase in Pps/Pmus max narrows the synchronized zone, making inspiratory termination predisposed to be in asynchrony. Increasing the expiratory trigger sensitivity of a ventilator shifts the synchronized zone to the right, causing less delayed and more premature termination. Automation of expiratory trigger sensitivity in future mechanical ventilators may also be possible. In conclusion, our model provides a useful tool to analyze the mechanisms of expiratory asynchrony in PSV.},

abstract = {The loss of pulmonary vessels has been shown to be related to the severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The severity of hypoxaemia is also related to pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary vascular resistance in these patients, suggesting that the hypoxic condition probably plays an important role in this form of pulmonary hypertension. However, pulmonary hypertension also develops in patients with mild COPD without hypoxaemia. Oxygen supplementation therapy often fails to reverse the pulmonary hypertension in these COPD patients, thus suggesting that the pulmonary vascular alterations in those patients may involve different sites of the pulmonary vasculature or a different form of vascular remodelling. It has recently been demonstrated that pulmonary vascular remodelling, resulting in pulmonary hypertension in COPD patients, can develop independently from parenchymal destruction and loss of lung vessels. We wonder whether the changes in the lung microenvironment due to hypoxia and vessel loss have a causative role in the development of pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD. Herein we review the pathobiological features of the pulmonary vasculature in COPD patients and suggest that pulmonary hypertension can occur with and without emphysematous lung tissue destruction and with and without loss of lung vessels.},

abstract = {The lung is a common site of complications of systemic connective tissue disease (CTD), and lung involvement can present in several ways. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension are the most common lung manifestations in CTD. Although it is generally thought that interstitial lung disease develops later on in CTD it is often the initial presentation ("lung dominant" CTD). ILD can be present in most types of CTD, including rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis or dermatomyositis, Sj{\"{o}}grens syndrome, and mixed connective tissue disease. Despite similarities in clinical and pathologic presentation, the prognosis and treatment of CTD associated ILD (CTD-ILD) can differ greatly from that of other forms of ILD, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can present as a primary vasculopathy in pulmonary arterial hypertension or in association with ILD (PH-ILD). Therefore, detailed history, physical examination, targeted serologic testing, and, occasionally, lung biopsy are needed to diagnose CTD-ILD, whereas both non-invasive and invasive assessments of pulmonary hemodynamics are needed to diagnose pulmonary hypertension. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment for ILD, although data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to support specific treatments are lacking. Furthermore, treatment strategies vary according to the clinical situation-for example, the treatment of a patient newly diagnosed as having CTD-ILD differs from that of someone with an acute exacerbation of the disease. Immunosuppression is indicated only in select cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension related to CTD; more commonly, selective pulmonary vasodilators are used. For both diseases, comorbidities such as sleep disordered breathing, symptoms of dyspnea, and cough should be evaluated and treated. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with advanced disease but is not always feasible because of other manifestations of CTD and comorbidities. Clinical trials of novel therapies including immunosuppressive therapies are needed to inform best treatment strategies.},

Chronic cough is a feature of many respiratory diseases, and common triggers (asthma, esophageal reflux, and postnasal drip) should be routinely ruled out by testing or by treatment trials. Investigation and treatment algorithms are based largely on consensus opinion, and more data are needed from randomized trials. Limited data from clinical trials support a benefit of low-dose morphine, gabapentin or pregabalin, and speech therapy for patients with cough persisting after other investigations and empirical treatments. Newer evidence suggests that cough reflex hyperresponsiveness underlies chronic cough, although more research is needed into the mechanisms and associated potential treatments.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: During pressure-support ventilation, the ventilator cycles into expiration when inspiratory flow decreases to a given percentage of peak inspiratory flow ("expiratory trigger"). In obstructive disease, the slower rise and decrease of inspiratory flow entails delayed cycling, an increase in intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and nontriggering breaths. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that setting expiratory trigger at a higher than usual percentage of peak inspiratory flow would attenuate the adverse effects of delayed cycling. METHODS: Ten intubated patients with obstructive disease undergoing pressure support were studied at expiratory trigger settings of 10, 25, 50, and 70{\%} of peak inspiratory flow. MEASUREMENTS: Continuous recording of diaphragmatic EMG activity with surface electrodes, and esophageal and gastric pressures with a dual-balloon nasogastric tube. MAIN RESULTS: Compared with expiratory trigger 10, expiratory trigger 70 reduced the magnitude of delayed cycling (0.25 +/- 0.18 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.72 s, p {\textless} 0.05), intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 2.2 cm H(2)O, p {\textless} 0.05), nontriggering breaths (2 +/- 3 vs. 9 +/- 5 breaths/min, p {\textless} 0.05), and triggering pressure-time product (0.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.7 cm H2O . s, p {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Setting expiratory trigger at a higher percentage of peak inspiratory flow in patients with obstructive disease during pressure support improves patient-ventilator synchrony and reduces inspiratory muscle effort. Further studies should explore whether these effects can influence patient outcome.},

Relative pulmonary artery (PA) enlargement, defined as a PA to ascending aorta (A) diameter ratio greater than one (PA:A{\textgreater}1) identifies patients at increased risk for exacerbations. However, little is known about the correlation between PA:A, echocardiography, and invasive hemodynamics in COPD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study of patients with severe COPD being evaluated for lung transplantation at a single center between 2007 and 2011 was conducted. Clinical characteristics, CT scans, echocardiograms, and right-sided heart catheterizations were reviewed. The PA diameter at the bifurcation and A diameter from the same CT image were measured. Linear and logistic regression were used to examine the relationships between PA:A ratio by CT scan and PA systolic pressure (PASP) by echocardiogram with invasive hemodynamics. Receiver operating characteristic analysis assessed the usefulness of the PA:A ratio and PASP in predicting resting pulmonary hypertension (PH) (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mPAP]{\textgreater}25 mm Hg).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sixty patients with a mean predicted FEV1 of 27{\%}±12{\%} were evaluated. CT scan-measured PA:A correlated linearly with mPAP after adjustment for multiple covariates (r=0.30, P=.03), a finding not observed with PASP. In a multivariate logistic model, mPAP was independently associated with PA:A{\textgreater}1 (OR, 1.44; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-2.04; P=.04).

abstract = {BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship of smoking duration with respiratory symptoms and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the South Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey in 2012. METHODS Data from 4,135 adults aged ≥45 years with a smoking history were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression that accounted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, and current smoking status, as well as the complex sampling design. RESULTS The distribution of smoking duration ranged from 19.2{\%} (1-9 years) to 36.2{\%} (≥30 years). Among 1,454 respondents who had smoked for ≥30 years, 58.3{\%} were current smokers, 25.0{\%} had frequent productive cough, 11.2{\%} had frequent shortness of breath, 16.7{\%} strongly agreed that shortness of breath affected physical activity, and 25.6{\%} had been diagnosed with COPD. Prevalence of COPD and each respiratory symptom was lower among former smokers who quit ≥10 years earlier compared with current smokers. Smoking duration had a linear relationship with COPD (P{\textless}0.001) and all three respiratory symptoms (P{\textless}0.001) after adjusting for smoking status and other covariates. While COPD prevalence increased with prolonged smoking duration in both men and women, women had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of COPD in the 1-9 years, 20-29 years, and ≥30 years duration periods. CONCLUSION These state population data confirm that prolonged tobacco use is associated with respiratory symptoms and COPD after controlling for current smoking behavior.},

abstract = {The lung is frequently involved in connective tissue diseases (CTDs), although the frequency of lung manifestations varies according to the type of CTD. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are frequently seen in CTDs, particularly systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), accounting for a significant proportion of deaths. A large percentage of patients with CTD-associated ILD has limited and stable disease, not requiring treatment. However, a significant minority has severe and/or progressive disease, necessitating prompt initiation of treatment. CTD-ILD histological patterns include non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), organizing pneumonia (OP), diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). NSIP is the most common pattern in all CTDs, except for RA, characterized by a higher frequency of UIP. ILD can present acutely or chronically, with acute presentations being more common in systemic lupus erythematosus and PM/DM. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressively worsening ILD characterized by inflammation and fibrosis. The characteristic histological pattern of IPF is UIP. Interestingly, a UIP pattern is associated with a significantly better survival in CTD-related disease compared to the idiopathic variety. Prognosis in IPF is dismal, with a median survival since diagnosis of 2-3 years. No treatment regimen has been shown to improve survival in IPF. By contrast, although there have been only two randomized placebo-controlled trials investigating the effect of immunosuppressive treatment in SSc-associated ILD, clinical experience suggests that immunosuppressive drugs in CTD-related ILDs are capable of benefiting a significant proportion of patients, particularly those with certain histological patterns of disease. This review will essentially focus on CTD-associated ILD and will compare aspects of clinical presentation and management to those of IPF. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011.},

abstract = {Acute respiratory failure is caused by many factors and remains one of the most common reasons for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In all cases of acute respiratory failure, there is a shortage of surfactant at the alveolar level. This deficit of surfactant leads to an increase in alveolar surface tension that increases the retraction forces of the lung, leading to end-expiratory alveolar collapse, finally resulting in respiratory dysfunction, which includes hypoxemia, low lung compliance, increase of intrapulmonary shunts, low functional residual capacity, atelectasis, and pulmonary edema. The goal of the treatment and prevention of acute respiratory failure is therefore based on the following three main items: re-opening the collapsed alveolar units; preserving the active surfactant component in the remaining functional alveolar units, and preventing end-expiratory collapse. The following strategies can be used to prevent and/or treat acute respiratory failure: counterbalancing the retraction forces of the lung by applying sufficiently high external pressures; and/or decreasing the surface tension at the air-liquid interface by means of exogenous surfactant, and/or eliminating the air-liquid interface by filling the lung with perfluorocarbons. By applying these therapeutic strategies in routine clinical practice, we should achieve a reduction in the mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory failure.

Although generally safe, thoracentesis may be complicated by transient hypoxemia, bleeding, patient discomfort, reexpansion pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax. OBJECTIVE: To identify the best means for differentiating between transudative and exudative effusions and also to identify thoracentesis techniques for minimizing the risk of complications by performing a systematic review the evidence. DATA SOURCES: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to February 2014 to identify relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized and observational studies of adult patients undergoing thoracentesis that examined diagnostic tests for differentiating exudates from transudates and evaluated thoracentesis techniques associated with a successful procedure with minimal complications. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted data from studies of laboratory diagnosis of pleural effusion for calculation of likelihood ratios (LRs; n = 48 studies) and factors affecting adverse event rates (n = 37 studies). RESULTS: The diagnosis of an exudate was most accurate if cholesterol in the pleural fluid was greater than 55 mg/dL (LR range, 7.1-250), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was greater than 200 U/L (LR, 18; 95{\%} CI, 6.8-46), or the ratio of pleural fluid cholesterol to serum cholesterol was greater than 0.3 (LR, 14; 95{\%} CI, 5.5-38). A diagnosis of exudate was less likely when all Light's criteria (a ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein {\textgreater}0.5, a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH {\textgreater}0.6, or pleural fluid LDH {\textgreater}two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH) were absent (LR, 0.04; 95{\%} CI, 0.02-0.11). The most common complication of thoracentesis was pneumothorax, which occurred in 6.0{\%} of cases (95{\%} CI, 4.0{\%}-7.0{\%}). Chest tube placement was required in 2.0{\%} of procedures (95{\%} CI, 0.99{\%}-2.9{\%}) in which a patient was determined to have radiographic evidence of a pneumothorax. With ultrasound, a radiologist's marking the needle insertion site was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (skin marking vs no skin marking odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95{\%} CI, 0.08-1.7). Use of ultrasound by any experienced practitioner also was not associated with decreased pneumothorax events (OR, 0.55; 95{\%} CI, 0.06-5.3). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Light's criteria, cholesterol and pleural fluid LDH levels, and the pleural fluid cholesterol-to-serum ratio are the most accurate diagnostic indicators for pleural exudates. Ultrasound skin marking by a radiologist or ultrasound-guided thoracentesis were not associated with a decrease in pneumothorax events.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze prospectively the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and clinical outcome in patients treated with prednisone for exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department were randomized to receive 40 mg prednisone daily for 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled manner. The HPA axis was longitudinally assessed with the 1 $\mu$g corticotropin test and a clinical hypocortisolism score at baseline, on day 6 before blinded treatment, at hospital discharge, and for up to 180 days of follow-up. Prednisone was stopped abruptly, irrespective of the test results. Patients discharged with pathological test results received instructions about emergency hydrocortisone treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 311 patients were included in the analysis. Mean basal and stimulated serum total cortisol levels were highest on admission (496±398 and 816±413 nmol/l respectively) and lowest on day 6 (235±174 and 453±178 nmol/l respectively). Pathological stimulation tests were found in 63, 38, 9, 3, and 2{\%} of patients on day 6, at discharge, and on days 30, 90, and 180 respectively, without significant difference between treatment groups. Clinical indicators of hypocortisolism did not correlate with stimulation test results, but cortisol levels were inversely associated with re-exacerbation risk. There were no hospitalizations or deaths as a result of adrenal crisis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Dynamic changes in the HPA axis occur during and after the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. In hypocortisolemic patients who were provided with instructions about stress prophylaxis, the abrupt termination of prednisone appeared safe.},

abstract = {Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitis is a non-IgE mediated hypersensitivity disease initiated by inhalation and subsequent sensitisation to organic antigens. These diseases have been described in different occupational groups and present in acute, subacute or chronic forms based on the exposure to antigens and host response. Clinical features are dependent upon the stage of the disease and can include fever, chills, cough, dyspnoea, and weight loss. The immunopathogenesis involves both cellular immunity and antibody responses to inhaled antigens. Antibody response to the implicated antigen can be demonstrated in HP patients, but such antibodies are also detected in antigen exposed asymptomatic individuals. Bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrates lymphocytosis and preponderance of CD8+ cells. Pulmonary function studies demonstrate a restrictive pattern with diffusion defects. The diagnosis is difficult as no single test is confirmatory, hence information from clinical, radiological, physiological, and immunological evaluations may be used together for a confirmative diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The treatment of choice is avoidance of antigen but systemic corticosteroids may be effective in suppressing the inflammatory response. The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and effective antigen avoidance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare complication of sarcoidosis, although it is not uncommon in advanced disease. METHODS A retrospective series of 22 sarcoidosis patients (16 men) of mean (SD) age 46 (13) years with PH was divided into two groups depending on the absence (stage 0: n = 2, stage II: n = 4, stage III: n = 1) or presence (n = 15) of radiographic pulmonary fibrosis at the time of PH diagnosis. RESULTS In both groups PH was moderate to severe and there was no response to acute vasodilator challenge. In non-fibrotic cases no other cause of PH was found, suggesting a specific sarcoidosis vasculopathy, although no histological specimens were available. In cases with fibrosis there was no correlation between haemodynamics and lung volumes or arterial oxygen tensions, suggesting other mechanisms for PH in addition to pulmonary destruction and hypoxaemia. These included extrinsic arterial compression by lymphadenopathies in three cases and histologically proven pulmonary veno-occlusive disease in the five patients who underwent lung transplantation. Ten patients received high doses of oral prednisone for PH (stage 0: n = 1, stage II: n = 4 and stage IV: n = 5); three patients without pulmonary fibrosis experienced a sustained haemodynamic response. Survival of the overall population was poor (59{\%} at 5 years). Mortality was associated with NYHA functional class IV but not with haemodynamic parameters or with lung function. CONCLUSION Two very different phenotypes of sarcoidosis combined with PH are observed depending on the presence or absence of pulmonary fibrosis. PH is a severe complication of sarcoidosis.},

All age groups are affected with rapidly growing importance in elderly people, particularly in countries with ageing populations. Present estimates suggest a pulmonary hypertension prevalence of about 1{\%} of the global population, which increases up to 10{\%} in individuals aged more than 65 years. In almost all parts of the world, left-sided heart and lung diseases have become the most frequent causes of pulmonary hypertension. About 80{\%} of affected patients live in developing countries, where pulmonary hypertension is frequently associated with congenital heart disease and various infectious disorders, including schistosomiasis, HIV, and rheumatic heart disease. These forms of pulmonary hypertension occur predominantly in those younger than 65 years. Independently of the underlying disease, the development of pulmonary hypertension is associated with clinical deterioration and a substantially increased mortality risk. Global research efforts are needed to establish preventive strategies and treatments for the various types of pulmonary hypertension.},

Physiol. 16(3) : 473-484. 1961 .-The relationships of changes in respiration and brain blood flow index to alterations in arterial and internal jugular venous blood pCO2, [HCO,], and plA were studied in normal men. Observations during control of alveolar pCO2, first at 44 and then at 50 mm Hg, represented the effects of CO2 breathing, Intravenous infusion of NaHC03 solution (ca. 2.4 mEq/kg) while maintaining alveolar pC0z at 50 mm Hg revealed the responses to a lowering of blood [H+] without: concurrent change in arterial or internal jugular venous pCO2. Brain blood flow index varied directly with alteration in blood pC0{\~{}} and was unaffected by changes in blood pH not produced by pC02 change. Respiratory measurements indicated a prominent relationship between respiration and blood hydrogen ion concentration, the reversal of the acidemia normally associated with CO 2 administration removing approximately 4570 of respiratory stimulation induced by hyper-capnia. The remaining 55{\%} of the increased ventilation caused by CO2 breathing was not directly related to changes in arterial or internal jugular venous blood pH or [HCO,]. The residual respiratory effect of CO2 administration was correlated, not only with alteration of pCO2, but with calculated changes in the pH of cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, the total respiratory stimulation produced by CO2 breathing, and its diminution by bicarbonate infusion, can be quantitatively described either in terms of a single stimulus index, hydrogen ion concentration , or in terms of two factors, pH and pCU2. Choice between single and muItiple acid-base factors as indices of chemical stimuli in respiratory control remains arbitrary. However, the discussion re-emphasizes that, while respiratory changes do occur when blood pH is altered without: change of blood or central pCO2, comparable stimulant effects of molecular CO2 cannot be demonstrated without somewhere producing concurrent modification of pH.
